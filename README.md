# SmartLudo

Welcome to **SmartLudo**! This is a decentralized game built on the Ethereum blockchain, specifically deployed on the Lisk Sepolia Testnet. The game allows players to throw dice and move around a virtual board, simulating the classic Ludo experience.

## Features

- **Dice Rolling:** Players can roll a dice to determine how many spaces to move.
- **Player Tracking:** Each player's position is tracked on the board.
- **Event Emission:** The game emits events whenever a player moves, allowing for real-time updates.



## Deployment

The smart contract has been deployed on the Lisk Sepolia Testnet. You can interact with the game using the following contract address:

**Contract Address:** `0x435853911835dE8e99F29B865711D6B8E035C371`

## How to Play

1. **Connect to a Wallet:** Use a Web3-enabled wallet like MetaMask to connect to the Sepolia Testnet.
2. **Add the Testnet:** Ensure you have the Sepolia Testnet added to your wallet with the correct RPC settings.
3. **Interact with the Contract:** Use a decentralized application (dApp) interface or directly interact through Remix or another Solidity development environment.

## Getting Started

To get started, make sure you have:

- A Web3 wallet (e.g., MetaMask) configured for the Sepolia Testnet.
- Some Sepolia ETH, which you can obtain from a faucet.
